The following example creates a sample buffer of bytes by first making a String and then using the getBytes( ) method to extract the byte array equivalent. It thencreates three files. The first, file1.txt, will contain every other byte from the sample. The second, file2.txt, will contain the entire set of bytes. The third and last, file3.txt, will contain only the last quarter. Unlike the FileInputStream methods, all of the FileOutputStream methods have a return type of void. In the case of an error, these methods will throw an IOException.
